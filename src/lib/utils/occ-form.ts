 * discarded stale write fired a "Saved" toast. Status codes do not discriminate
 * it: an action can `fail(400, { form, error })` semantically on a payload that
 * satisfied its schema (`applyPrivacyPreset`'s `!preset` guard does exactly that,
 * because `presetId` is `.optional()`), while a genuine schema failure carries
 * `form.valid === false` and must be left to `onUpdated`'s field-error branch.
 *
 * ORDERING CONTRACT: an OCC conflict returned after the pre-write check is ALSO a
 * post-validation failure, so a caller that runs {@link surfaceOccConflict} must
 * early-return on `isOccConflict(result.data)` before consulting this predicate.
 * `surfaceOccConflict` cancels but does not stop the caller, so skipping that
 * early return toasts every 409 twice.
 *
 * Kept next to {@link isOccConflict} because both inspect the same failure payload
 * and both are consumed at the `onUpdate` layer.
