// call. Without this cache, every blocked/rate-limited request triggers a fresh
// SQLite scan via isProxiedHttps() — defensive short-circuits should shed load,
// not amplify it. Admin write sites MUST call _resetTrustProxyCache() AFTER the
// DB write completes so subsequent requests re-resolve the new value.
//
// We cache the in-flight Promise rather than the resolved boolean. This makes
// reset-during-resolve race-safe: a concurrent _resetTrustProxyCache() nulls
// the slot, but any request already awaiting the old promise keeps its
// reference via closure. The successful .then path never writes back to the
// slot on resolution, so it cannot pollute the cache after reset.
//
// Rejections are self-evicting with an identity check: if
// getTrustProxyConfigWithSource() rejects (or the .then callback throws), the
// chained .catch nulls the slot ONLY when its own promise is still the current
// one. That guard prevents a late rejection from a pre-reset chain from
// clobbering a freshly-populated post-reset chain. The current caller still
// fails fast, and the next miss starts a fresh fetch — so a transient DB error
// cannot stick a rejected promise in the cache indefinitely.
