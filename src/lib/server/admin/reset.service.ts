/**
 * Complete instance reset — delete every row Obzorarr owns and return the
 * install to its first-run state.
 *
 * Scope and non-goals:
 * - Rows only. The schema and `drizzle/` migration state are never touched;
 *   `db/client.ts` auto-migrates on import and a dropped/re-created schema would
 *   desynchronise the migration journal.
 * - Environment-configured settings are NOT application data. PLEX_*, OPENAI_*,
 *   ORIGIN and TRUST_PROXY live in the process environment, survive this wipe,
 *   and are re-applied by `clearConflictingDbSettings()` at the next startup —
 *   so an env-configured instance's post-reset onboarding is partly pre-filled.
 * - The in-memory bootstrap token is deliberately left alone. The reset flow
 *   shows the admin a fresh claim token BEFORE wiping, and destroying it here
 *   (as `clearOnboardingClaim()` would, via `clearBootstrapToken()`) would strand
 *   them on the claim screen with a token that no longer validates.
